=============================
fsv -- File System Visualizer
=============================

fsv is a visual file browser that uses GL to draw a very cool visualization of
directories and their contents. It is a clone of fsn, the SGI file browser
featured in Jurassic Park.

Requirements
============

* GTK+ 1.2
* OpenGL 1.1
* GTKGLArea 1.2

GTKGLArea 1.2 is not available in most distributions; you will have to go on
adventures to retrieve it yourself. Good luck.

Daniel Richard G. originally wrote this in 1999, and maintenance was picked up
by Corbin Simpson in 2010.
