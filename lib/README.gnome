The Gnome files here were ripped out of libgnome and libgnomeui (in the
gnome-libs tarball) and have been modified slightly:

gnome-*: Removed trivial Gnome dependencies (BEGIN_GNOME_DECLS et. al.)

gnome-color-picker: Hacked out the GdkImlib dependency. This widget now
	works with pure GTK+, sans alpha rendering and dithering.

gnome-dateedit: Contains a small hack to clear the popdown calendar after
	a single-click date selection (instead of after a double-click).
